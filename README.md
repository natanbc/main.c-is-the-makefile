`make -f main.c run`

# WHY

Why not

# I HATE YOU

Me too

# How the fuck

`main.c` is C code embedded inside a Makefile, which is embedded in C code.

- C compilers ignore all the text between `#if 0` and `#endif`
- `#` marks a line as a comment in a Makefile
- make ignores all text between `ifeq (A,B)` and `endif`

# Bonus

There's also a makefile that's a valid C program in the `bonus` folder.
`make run` it.
